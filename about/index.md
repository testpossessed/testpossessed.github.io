Hello and welcome,  I am Mike Hanson a software developer with 20+ years experience of developing enterprise scale desktop, web and more recently mobile applications.

I am extremely passionate about doing things the agile way and building quality into software from the start through Test Driven Development as originally conceived by Kent Beck et al.

I am a big fan of Uncle Bob (Bob Martin) and his books Clean Code and Clean Coder are with me on my iPad at all times. Right alongside Growing Object-Oriented Software Guided by Tests by Nat Pryce and Steve Freeman.  These books represent my bible of software development and I push them on colleagues at every opportunity.

I love to share my experience and knowledge with anyone who will listen.
